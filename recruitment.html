    <h3> More info about the project</h3>
    <p>
    Structured prediction is concerned with predicting multiple interdependent variables. This project will develop the fundamental science for the next generation of structured-prediction algorithms, which will have a significant impact on a large variety of applications, such as social graphs, natural language processing, action recognition and computational biology. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We will develop techniques for deep learning of features in structured prediction, along with Bayesian approaches for the characterisation and quantification of uncertainty. The immediate impact of these will be reflected in better accuracy of the resulting algorithms and in a significant reduction in the amount of annotated data they require for learning.
    </p>
<p>
  Example papers of the type of research I do can be found at my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> page. In particular, our recent work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04386">Random Feature Expansions for Deep Gaussian Processes</a> and <a href="papers/galliani-et-al-aistats-2016.pdf">Gray-box Inference for Structured Gaussian Process Models</a> are strongly related to the aims of the project.

outstanding student and (b) your project proposal&nbsp; is aligned with
my research interest <br>
</p>


 <h3>Potential PhD Topics</h3>

<p>
 <br> Your PhD proposal must be related to things I am actually interested in. As you may have seen on this site, I work in the general area of machine learning and am particularly excited by problems in probabilistic modelling and inference. Here a suggested list of topics/areas for your proposal:

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Network structure discovery and causality</em>.
    I always refer to the problem of determining the causes of a phenomenon (call it cancer, un- employment, depression, etc.) as the 'holy grail' of science and ultimately is the question that most scientists want to answer. One of the most difficult problems in this area is to determine what we can infer in terms of causal relationships from purely observational studies. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08530" target="_blank">this paper</a> and references therein as an example.

  <li>
    <em> Automated probabilistic reasoning and implicit models. </em>
    One of my long-term goals in probabilistic modelling and reasoning is to have flexible models and automated yet scalable inference methods for them. This covers the areas of implicit models and 'black-box' inference. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08896" target="_blank">this paper</a>, also <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00577" target="_blank">this one</a> and references therein. I believe that by having flexible priors, flexible likelihood models and flexible approximate posteriors, along with fast and scalable inference algorithms, we have the potential the revolutionise scientific research and Bayesian inference in general.
  </li>

  <li>
    <em> Structured prediction.</em>
    Structured prediction is concerned with predicting multiple interdependent variables. My goal here is to develop the fundamental science for the next generation of structured-prediction algorithms, which will have a significant impact on a large variety of applications, such as social graphs, natural language processing, action recognition and computational biology. See <a href="papers/galliani-et-al-aistats-2016.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> and references therein. 
  </li>

  <li>
    <em> Bayesian deep learning. </em>
    Deep learning has revolutionised application areas such as computer vision but there is strong evidence that these machine-learning frameworks are 'data-hungry' and can be very poor at quantifying predictive uncertainty (see e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599" target="_blank">this paper</a> as a recent reference). My goal here is to develop sound uncertainty-quantification approaches in deep learning architectures. Our <a href="papers/cutajar-et-al-icml-2017.pdf" target="_blank">ICML 2017 paper</a> with collaborators at EURECOM describes a  step on this direction.
  </li> 

  <li> 
  <em> Applications. </em>
  I am very interested in applications in the areas of renewable energy (e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-71643-5_9" target="_blank">solar energy forecasting</a>) and climate change, natural language processing, machine learning for good (think health, fairness, etc), Bayesian optimisation and reinforcement learning.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
   <p>
     The above list is by no means exhaustive and you are welcome to propose your own ideas, taking into consideration my research and <a href="publications.html">publications</a>.

     <font color="red"> Please note that I am no longer willing to supervise students wanting to work on compiler optimization and that under no circumstances I will supervise a student willing to work on genetic algorithhms, evolutionary computation or any sexually-motivated computer science area.
